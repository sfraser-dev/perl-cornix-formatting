# cornix free text max entries and targets is 10
# cornix free text only allows 1 SL
# if only 1 entry/target, the "high" value is used

# to do:
# -- HeavyWeightingAtEntryOrStoploss for targets too (just done entries for now)
# -- no single TP, issue with cornix and changing it's ratio (95% and 5% on similar value)?
# -- different weightings: (exponential (50/25/12/6/3), balanced-in-twos (10/10/15/15/25/25)
# -- add options: -c chart, -w weightingFactor, -h heavySideEntryOrSL
# -- remove need to type long or short from here (can tell if long or short from entry/SL/TP)
# -- blacksphere/loma fixed risk fluid position, calc compound position size if not all entries hit
