# cornix free text max entries and targets is 10
# cornix free text only allows 1 SL
# if only 1 entry/target, the "high" value is used
# set leverage "-1" to not use leverage
# decimalPlaces controls the amount of decimal places for entries, targets and the stop-loss (percentage weightings hardcoded to 2 decimal places)

# file: config file to use [-f]
# ewf: entry weighting factor [-e]
# twf: target weighting factor [-t]
# aoe: amount of entries (override value in config file) [-a]
# not: number of targets (override value in config file) [-n]
# dev: dynamic entry value (fixed risk dynamic position size) [-d]

# to do:
# DONE!! remove need to type long or short from here (can tell if long or short from entry/SL/TP)
# DONE!! weightingFactor into here.. no, command line better for weightingFactor
# DONE!! HeavyWeightingAtEntryOrStoploss for targets too (just done entries for now)
# DONE!! clean up hard-written template strings, put them in the functions?
# DONE!! cornix can remove leading decimals for low sat coins - 888, not 0.0000888 - done with decimal places variable here
# blacksphere/loma fixed risk fluid position, calc compound position size if not all entries hit

# DONE!! add option -h heavyEntrySideOrSLside (just use +/- for the weighting factors to control this)
# no single TP, issue with cornix and changing it's ratio (95% and 5% on similar value)?
# different weightings: (exponential (50/25/12/6/3), balanced-in-twos (10/10/15/15/25/25)
# add options: -c chart
# calculate R for each TP and SLBE
# calculate SL-trick: how much to take off to make trade risk free (without moving SL)
