# cornix free text max entries and targets is 10
# cornix free text only allows 1 SL
# if only 1 entry/target, the "high" value is used

# to do:
# DONE!! remove need to type long or short from here (can tell if long or short from entry/SL/TP)
# DONE!! weightingFactor into here.. no, command line better for weightingFactor
# DONE!! HeavyWeightingAtEntryOrStoploss for targets too (just done entries for now)
# DONE!! clean up hard-written template strings, put them in the functions?
# cornix can remove leading decimals for low sat coins (888, not 0.0000888), account for this (sprintf?)
# blacksphere/loma fixed risk fluid position, calc compound position size if not all entries hit

# no single TP, issue with cornix and changing it's ratio (95% and 5% on similar value)?
# different weightings: (exponential (50/25/12/6/3), balanced-in-twos (10/10/15/15/25/25)
# add options: -c chart, -h heavyEntrySideOrSLside
# calculate R for each TP and SLBE
